# Real Estate Price Prediction using Linear Regression


## a. Problem Description
- To predict the prices of the House (Estate) using the Number of Convenience Stores available in those areas using Simple Linear Regression
- The dataset used for building the model is a Comma Separated Value(.csv) file that contains 414 records.
- The <b> Number of Convenience Stores , House Price of Unit Areas </b> are the two columns that we are using to build a model upon.

### 1) Understanding Linear Regression 
It tries to find out the best possible linear relationship between the input features and the target variable (y).

That‚Äôs it! This is what Linear Regression does. Pretty simple right?üòÉ

In machine learning jargon the above can be stated as ‚Äú<b> It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that best fits the data which has the target variable(dependent variable) as a linear combination of the input features(independent variables) ‚Äù</b>

```
NOTE:

1. The target variable is also known as an independent variable or label.
2. Input features are also known as dependent variables.
```

## b. Libraries Dependencies 
* numpy -  for working with numerical arrays 
* pandas -  for working with the dataset
* sklearn - used for various operations to get the desired  task
* matplotlib -  used for working with graphs

Python 2 and 3 both work for this.

```
